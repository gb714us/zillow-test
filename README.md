# Zillow Retsly Application
* * *

This is a quick prototype that uses the Retsly API to show listings based on the test dataset.

This application uses Node.js + Express to fetch data from the API, and it uses simple React on the front end.
It uses babel for latest JS features + SASS.

To run locally:

```
npm run start
```
